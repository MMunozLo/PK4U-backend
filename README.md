This repository contains the **Backend** of the PK4U system, the core of the application's business logic. Developed with **Java** and **Spring Boot**, this service is responsible for:

-   Exposing a **RESTful API** to be consumed by the Frontend.
-   Managing data persistence with **MongoDB**.
-   Processing parking spot status updates asynchronously via **RabbitMQ**.
-   Integrating with **Elasticsearch** to provide advanced search capabilities.
-   Registering with and discovering other services through the **Eureka Service Registry**.

## üöÄ Local Deployment

To run the backend service locally, you will need to have its dependency ecosystem active.

### **üìã Prerequisites**

-   **JDK 21** (or the version specified in the `pom.xml`).
-   **Maven** or **Gradle** for dependency management and project building.

### **1. External Dependencies** üì¶

The backend needs to connect to the following services.

-   **MongoDB**: The primary database.
-   **RabbitMQ**: Message broker for asynchronous communication with the simulator.
-   **Elasticsearch**: Engine for text-based searches.
-   **Eureka Server**: Must be running for this service to register itself.

### **2. Clone the Repository ‚¨áÔ∏è**

```bash
git clone [https://github.com/MMunozLo/PK4U-backend.git](https://github.com/MMunozLo/PK4U-backend.git)
cd PK4U-backend
```

### 3. Environment Setup üõ†Ô∏è
The application's configuration is managed in the `src/main/resources/application.yml` file. Ensure that the connection properties for databases and external services are correct for your local environment.

Example `application.yml`:

```yaml
server:
  port: 8081 # Port for this microservice

spring:
  application:
    name: pk4u-ms # Service name to register in Eureka
  data:
    mongodb:
      uri: mongodb://localhost:27017/pk4u # URI for your MongoDB instance
  rabbitmq:
    host: localhost
    port: 5672
  elasticsearch:
    uris: http://localhost:9200

eureka:
  client:
    service-url:
      defaultZone: http://localhost:8761/eureka # URL of your Eureka Server
```

### 4. Running the Application ‚ñ∂Ô∏è
You can run the application using the Maven or Gradle plugin.

With Maven:

```bash
mvn spring-boot:run
```

With Gradle:

```bash
./gradlew bootRun
```

Once started, the service will register with **Eureka** and will be ready to receive requests through the **API Gateway**.

### 5. API Endpoints ‚öô

This service exposes the following RESTful endpoints, which are routed through the API Gateway.

| Method | Endpoint                             | Description                                      |
|:-------|:-------------------------------------|:-------------------------------------------------|
| `GET`  | `/api/v1/parkings`                   | Retrieves a list of all parkings.                |
| `GET`  | `/api/v1/parkings/{parkingId}`       | Gets the details of a specific parking.          |
| `GET`  | `/api/v1/parkings/{parkingId}/spots` | Lists all spots for a specific parking.          |
| `PUT`  | `/api/v1/parkings/{parkingId}/spots/{spotId}` | Updates the occupancy status of a specific spot. |
| `GET`  | `/api/v1/search`                     | Searches for parkings using Elasticsearch.       |

### 6. Running the Full System üåê
Keep in mind that the frontend is only the **presentation layer** of the PK4U system. for full functionality, you need to have all the backend services running.

Make sure to clone and run the following repositories in the recommended order:

| Order | Component             | Description                                                                                          | Repository                                                                    |

## üåü What is PK4U?

In modern cities, finding parking has become a daily challenge that causes stress and unnecessarily increases traffic and pollution. This phenomenon, known as _cruising for parking_, negatively affects the quality of life and urban sustainability.

**PK4U** was created to address this problem by offering an open-source solution that centralizes and displays real-time parking availability in a city. Our platform unifies data from multiple parking facilities into a single interface with interactive maps, empowering drivers to make better decisions and contributing to smarter, more sustainable mobility.
